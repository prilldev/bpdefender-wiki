## The Basics

Learn how to play the Roblox game [Ballpark Defender](https://www.roblox.com/games/12117545162/Ballpark-Defender) - a Tower Defense game with a baseball theme. Mobs invade a local ballpark and you have to strategically place 10 defenders and equip them with weapons to keep the ballpark from being destroyed. If the mobs reach home plate they slowly destroy your ballpark's health. You and your "Squad" of friends work together to kill the mobs before the ballpark is overrun.
